# Fast_Clicker
An auto clicker that clicks super fast for you. Just Execute the fast_click.py file, then press the "r" key (run) to start the auto clicker, then press the "q" key (quit) to stop the auto clicker, you can start and stop the auto clicker as much as you want. Only works on windows i think.
